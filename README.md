<table><tr><td><img src="https://math.jhu.edu/~savitt/GTM/massey.jpg" width=120 height=187 alt=""></td><td><p>If I were a Springer-Verlag Graduate Text in Mathematics, I would be William S. Massey's <b><i>A Basic Course in Algebraic Topology</i></b>.</p><p> I am intended to serve as a textbook for a course in algebraic topology at the beginning graduate level. The main topics covered are the classification of compact 2-manifolds, the fundamental group, covering spaces, singular homology theory, and singular cohomology theory. These topics are developed systematically, avoiding all unecessary definitions, terminology, and technical machinery. Wherever possible, the geometric motivation behind the various concepts is emphasized. </p><p>Which Springer GTM would <i>you</i> be?  <a href="https://math.jhu.edu/~savitt/GTM.html">The Springer GTM Test</a></p></td></tr></table>
