title: "Fock Spaces: An elegant approximation for multi-particle quantum systems"
---

Solving generic large quantum systems is a difficult problem. Physicists have come up with numerous techniques over the years to solve specific kinds of complex systems. For instance, the [Hartree-Fock Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartree%E2%80%93Fock_method) is used to approximate the lowest eigenvalue and the eigenstate of the [Hamiltionian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_(quantum_mechanics)). A complicated method just to _approximate_ the _ground state_!

Single particle systems are usually simpler to solve, because they do not have any interaction terms in the Hamiltonian.
