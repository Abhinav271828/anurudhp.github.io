title: "Awesome Software/Tools for Programming"
---

This is a collection of useful software and tools that I have found over my years of programming.

[Vim](https://www.vim.org/)/[Neovim](https://neovim.io/)
--------

An awesome text editor, and fantastic for programming. Very extensible and configurable.

[Sublime Merge](https://www.sublimemerge.com/)
-------------------------------------------------

Git made simple. Very useful for resolving merge conflicts, rebasing and selective staging.
